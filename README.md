# Ry (Ry's for You) v0.2

Ry is a lightweight, robust, and english-like language designed with a focus on stability and developer experience. Whether you're building simple scripts or exploring language design, Ry is built to be helpful, colorful, and fast.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Error Reporting**: Beautiful, color-coded error messages with caret pointers (`^~~`) to show you exactly where things went wrong.
- **Optimized Iteration**: High-level `foreach` loops and `range` expressions (`0 to 100`) designed for performance.
- **Smart REPL**: A dynamic interactive shell with auto-indentation tracking and colorized prompts.
- **Built for Stability**: A memory-conscious C++ core that respects your hardware limits.
- **Improved version of Ry**: An optimized core interpreter using bytecode

## Performance

Ry is built to be efficient. With an optimized custom c++ core that uses custom bytecode without external tools like
flex, bison, antlr or llvm
Ry also has a builtin keyword for looping through ranges ``foreach``: takes about 1 second in my laptop.
Test it yourself:
   ```bash
   $ ry run examples/speed_test.ry
   ```

## Installation

Ry comes with a built-in installer for Linux and Windows systems.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/johnryzon123/Ry2.git](https://github.com/johnryzon123/Ry2.git)
   cd Ry
   ```
2. **Build and Install:**

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

# Usage

**The REPL**
Simply type `ry` to enter the interactive shell.

  ```bash
  $ ry
  Ry (Ry's for you) REPL - Bytecode Edition
  ry> out(0 to 10)
  0..10
  ry>
  ```

**Running a Script**
  ```bash
  $ ry run script.ry
  ```

# Examples
```
# Range-based iteration
foreach data i in 1 to 3 {
    foreach data j in 10 to 13 {
        if j == 12 { stop } # stop is a new keyword in Ry 2.0.6
        # Ry also has skip which skips the current iteration
        out(i + " - " + j)
    }
    # Prints:
    # 1 - 10
    # 1 - 11
    # 2 - 10
    # 2 - 11
}

# Error reporting example
{
    print("Hello World") # Ry uses out() instead of print()
# Missing brackets or typos will be caught with helpful red pointers!
```
